                        <p>The main aim of the project is to design and develop blockchain and IOT based solution to safely produce and distribute food across the globe.Producers in the industry deserve the best of returns on products they distribute. Consumers, on the other hand, deserve the fairest of prices with an adequate transparent framework to confidently tell the origins of organic products.</p>

                        <p>Human Follower trolley</p>
                        <p>A shopping trolley is a necessary tool for shopping in supermarkets or grocery stores. However, there are shopping trolleys abandoned everywhere in supermarkets after being used. In addition, there are also shopping trolley safety issues such as sliding down from an escalator. It is known to be an inconvenience and time wasting for customers who are in rush to search for desired products in a supermarket. </p>
                        <p>In this project we tried to accomplish an semiautomatic or smart trolley system which requires a
                            minute manual work but can carry any amount of
                            weight based on the battery backup , motor’s torque
                            and speed. Smart Trolley system works with help of
                            Arduino and other sensors which are used to identify
                            the presence of a user.</p>
